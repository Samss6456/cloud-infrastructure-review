## Overview
This repository contains the implementation artifacts and documentation for a cloud security and optimization review project. The project focuses on reviewing a Docker-based workload running on a Linux virtual machine.

## Scope
- Linux Virtual Machine
- Docker container (Ubuntu 22.04)
- Application log review
- Security risk identification
- Optimization recommendations

## Repository Structure
- logs/: Sample application logs used for analysis
- screenshots/: Evidence of Docker execution and log review
- report/: Final technical review report submitted as PDF

## Notes
All logs and configurations are simulated for academic purposes. No real production data is included.
